# pirateradio

Docker containers packaging an mpd based internet radio station and transmitting
it over i2p.

## Explanation

I was always a big fan of Zoidberg's 'Deep Web Radio' services, they're still
around and still cool(also not hard to find. I'll post a link here soon.). But
I wanted to be able to do it myself, and host my own deep web radio services,
and make it easy for others to do so too. To that end, this set of scripts
creates three Docker containers, each running one of the tools necessary to make
a radio station accessible over i2p.
