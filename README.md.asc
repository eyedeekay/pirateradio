# pirateradio

Docker containers packaging an mpd based internet radio station and transmitting
it over i2p.

## Explanation

I was always a big fan of Zoidberg's 'Deep Web Radio' services, they're still
around and still cool(also not hard to find. I'll post a link here soon.). But
I wanted to be able to do it myself, and host my own deep web radio services,
and make it easy for others to do so too. To that end, this set of scripts
creates three Docker containers, each running one of the tools necessary to make
a radio station accessible over i2p.

## Usage

First, clone the repository and enter the directory

        git clone https://github.com/eyedeekay/pirateradio
        cd pirateradio

Now, run the script to generate the basic configuration files and start the
services:

        make install

Finally, add some music into the "music" directory. You can change the location
of the music directory by setting the music_dir environment variable. You will
need to use sudo to copy the music into the folder, as it's a docker volume and
mpd needs to control it in the container.

        sudo cp *.ogg music/

When you're ready, run mpc to re-generate the playlist.

        make mpc-start
